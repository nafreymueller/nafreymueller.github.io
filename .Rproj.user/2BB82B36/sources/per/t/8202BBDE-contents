I am a paleoecologist interested in species responses to ecological and climate changes throughout Earth's history. I often employ quantitative biogeographical models to elucidate unique patterns of faunal change.

I am currently finishing a masters degree analyzing Pleistocene megafelids in [Felisa Smith's lab](http://biology.unm.edu/fasmith/). I previously worked under the advisement of [Cori Myers](https://cemyers.weebly.com) for my undergraduate work, where I researched Cretaceous molluscan diversity dynamics.
